Read the [user manual](doc/user-manual.md).

## Running the program

The user manual contains information about how to use the program, but it doesn't describe how to start it up. You will either need:
1. A [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. An executable. I put one in the wiki mod chat a while ago and might do it in the future when this is more stable.

You will also need access to the game files. These are data mined and accessible to wiki mods, but if you're not one you'll need to find your own data mines. Your best public option is probably BCU, although BCU's folder structure is very different to the files that we have for wiki work. Unfortunately, due to PONOS crackdowns, we don't want to post the files on the wiki like we were able to do in the past.
