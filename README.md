Read the [user manual](doc/user/manual.md).

## Running the program

The user manual contains information about how to use the program, but it doesn't describe how to start it up. You will either need:
1. A [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. An executable. I put one in the wiki mod chat a while ago and might do it in the future when this is more stable.

You will also need access to the game files. If you don't know how to do this, see [mini-bc-data](https://github.com/YTFGolf/mini-bc-data).
