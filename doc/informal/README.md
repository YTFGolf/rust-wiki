This obviously isn't some big important repo and it's entirely maintained by one person, so the docs aren't gonna really properly gonna go over what's in my head when I write commits for this project. Therefore, I shall have an informal section of the docs! Mainly to write down my own thoughts somewhere. Don't expect this to be fully up-to-date or anything.

## Notes

- Difference between `into`, `to_string`, `to_owned`.
