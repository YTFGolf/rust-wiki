If not immediately obvious from the command, all instances of logging should indicate where they came from. Debug formatting (unless for an `Option` value as `None` is very opaque) usually means the thing will be self-explanatory, and if it's in the main workhorse function or file for a command then it's probably fine to not have an explicit origin indicator.

Different types of logging and when to use:

- trace: very detailed information about inner workings, only useful for tracking down bugs. Best use is to place these through while debugging, then just not remove them. Not actually used in this project.
- debug: detailed information about inner workings. Useful for tracking down bugs at a glance, or seeing detailed internal information that is collected but not displayed. Example is with special rules, where I don't need a full backtrace to see the full details of the new rule, I just want to see everything as it is written in code.
- info: normal messages about business as usual, but still something that could cause confusion. Potential example is from the Ta-Da! stage, where Ms. Sign was skipped but that ended up with it being blank and this wasn't caught until I went onto the stage in BCU. While the code should always be skipping Ms. Sign, being transparent about skipping Ms. Sign is a good idea; info is the best way to indicate this. Another case is where link-less stages are skipped in encounters; this happens very frequently and most of the time you can ignore it.
- warning: important info to the user. Similar to info, but for situations where you shouldn't just ignore the warning (e.g. if you really shouldn't expect this to happen, but you don't need to throw an error). For example, extra stages being in encounters is something that can potentially happen if `ContinueStages.csv` is not updated; it's basically saying "the output of this function is going to be wrong, so you need to fix the underlying problem (or alternatively, manually fix the output in this case), but I'll give you everything else you wanted because a full-on crash isn't necessary (i.e. you could still use the rest of the output perfectly fine)". Also useful where a feature is not implemented or is experimental, or in cases that have not yet been properly fixed. Another case is the gauntlet where all stages are different, this could possibly be info but it's A) something that happens very often so you can't just ignore it B) means that the entire script is useless for this map C) in this case the rest of the code will still run properly but it will end up missing most of its output, which could be really confusing to end users.
- error: something has gone catastrophically wrong and something needs to be completely aborted. Not actually used here because the code just panics and the panic forms a visible error.
