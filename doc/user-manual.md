## Quick start
`rust-wiki` will be used as a generic name for running the program. If you are
on Windows, substitute `rust-wiki.exe`. If you are using `cargo run`, substitute
`cargo run -- {args}` any time command-line arguments are specified.

1. Run `rust-wiki config` and follow the prompts given to set up your config.
2. Run `rust-wiki get` to download appropriate wiki files.
3. Run `rust-wiki help` to see what commands are available.
